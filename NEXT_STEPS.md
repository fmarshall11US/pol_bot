# Next Steps for AI Knowledge Base Optimization

## Current System Overview
Your insurance policy Q&A system is fully functional with:
- ✅ Document upload and processing
- ✅ Vector embeddings for semantic search
- ✅ AI-powered Q&A interface
- ✅ Underwriter knowledge integration
- ✅ Cross-policy search capabilities

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Test Vector Search Quality (High Priority)
Use the new `/test-search` page to:
- Test various queries against your uploaded documents
- Check similarity scores (aim for >0.7 for good matches)
- Identify queries that return poor results
- Verify that relevant content is being found

**Action Items:**
- Upload a test policy document
- Try queries like "deductible", "coverage limits", "exclusions"
- Note which queries work well and which don't

### 2. Optimize Search Parameters
Based on testing results:
- **Chunk Size**: Current is 1000 chars. Consider:
  - Smaller (500) for more precise matches
  - Larger (1500) for more context
- **Similarity Threshold**: Add minimum threshold (e.g., 0.5)
- **Match Count**: Increase from 5 to 8-10 for more context

### 3. Implement Cross-Document Search
Currently searches within a single document. Add:
- Global search across all policies
- Policy type filtering
- Date range filtering
- Relevance ranking across documents

### 4. Enhance AI Context Window
Improve answer quality by:
- Providing document metadata (policy type, date, insured)
- Including section headers in context
- Adding document summary as context
- Implementing conversation memory

### 5. Add Search Analytics
Track and improve:
- Most common questions
- Questions with low similarity scores
- User satisfaction (via feedback)
- Response time metrics

### 6. Implement Feedback Loop
- Thumbs up/down on answers
- Store feedback in database
- Use feedback to:
  - Identify poor performing queries
  - Adjust embeddings strategy
  - Fine-tune chunk sizes

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

1. **Test Current System**
   ```
   - Go to /test-search
   - Try: "what is my deductible"
   - Check if similarity > 0.7
   ```

2. **Add Similarity Threshold**
   ```typescript
   // In /app/api/qa/route.ts
   const MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.5;
   const relevantChunks = similarChunks?.filter(
     chunk => chunk.similarity > MIN_SIMILARITY
   );
   ```

3. **Improve Chunk Context**
   ```typescript
   // When creating chunks, include section headers
   const chunkWithContext = {
     content: chunk.content,
     section: currentSection,
     documentTitle: document.file_name
   };
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload at least 2 different policy types
- [ ] Test 10 different questions per policy
- [ ] Document which questions work well
- [ ] Note questions that return irrelevant results
- [ ] Check if underwriter hints improve results
- [ ] Test cross-document search scenarios

## Success Metrics

- **Good**: >70% of queries return relevant content with >0.7 similarity
- **Excellent**: >85% of queries return relevant content with >0.8 similarity
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for search + answer generation
- **User Satisfaction**: >80% positive feedback on answers
